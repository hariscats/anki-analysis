Azure OpenAI Service provides REST API access to OpenAI's powerful language models including GPT-4, GPT-3.5-turbo, and Embeddings models.

Key Features:
- Multiple model deployments with custom names
- Enterprise-grade security and compliance
- Content filtering and safety features
- Token-based pricing and quota management
- Integration with Azure security and identity

Authentication:
- Uses Azure Active Directory for secure access
- API keys for programmatic access
- Managed identity support for Azure resources

Important Parameters:
- Temperature: Controls randomness (0.0-2.0)
- Max tokens: Maximum response length
- Top-p: Nucleus sampling parameter
- Frequency penalty: Reduces repetition
- Presence penalty: Encourages topic diversity

Deployments can be managed through Azure portal or REST APIs.
Content filtering policies help ensure responsible AI use.

Python asyncio is a library for writing concurrent code using async/await syntax.

Key Concepts:
- Event loop: The core of asyncio that runs asynchronous tasks
- Coroutines: Functions defined with async def
- Tasks: Wrapped coroutines that can be scheduled
- Futures: Objects representing eventual results

Common Functions:
- asyncio.run(): Run an async function
- asyncio.create_task(): Schedule a coroutine
- asyncio.gather(): Run multiple coroutines concurrently
- asyncio.sleep(): Async version of time.sleep()

Benefits:
- Better performance for I/O-bound operations
- Cleaner code than traditional threading
- Built-in support for timeouts and cancellation
